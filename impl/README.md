# Implementation Module

This directory contains concrete implementations of the abstract classes defined in the `meta_define` module. These implementations provide the actual functionality for attacks, defenses, federated learning frameworks, and more.

## Overview

The `impl` module includes ready-to-use implementations that you can directly use in your experiments or extend to create your own custom versions.

## Files

### attack_attack_impl.py

Contains implementations of various Byzantine attacks:

- `DefaultAttack`: A baseline attack that returns honest gradients
- `ReversalGradient`: Reverses the direction of gradients
- `LabelFlipping`: Flips labels during training to generate poisoned gradients
- `Sine`: Implements the Sine attack
- `NoiseAttack`: Adds Gaussian noise to gradients
- `MinMaxAttack`: Implements the Min-Max attack
- `MinSumAttack`: Implements the Min-Sum attack

### attack_strategic_impl.py

Contains implementations of various defense strategies:

- `DefaultStrategic`: A baseline defense that performs no filtering
- `Krum`: Implements the Krum defense algorithm
- `FLTrust`: Implements the FLTrust defense algorithm
- `Gpf`: Implements the Gradient Projection Filter defense
- `Mahalanobis`: Implements the Mahalanobis distance-based defense

### fl_framework_impl.py

Contains implementations of federated learning frameworks:

- `FedAvg`: Implements the Federated Averaging algorithm

### fl_framework_client_train_impl.py

Contains implementations of client training behaviors:

- `ClientNormal`: Implements training for honest clients
- `ClientAdv`: Implements training for adversarial clients

### fl_task_impl.py

Contains implementations of task types:

- `Classification`: Implements classification tasks
- `Regression`: Implements regression tasks
- `Classification_DP`: Implements classification with differential privacy
- `Regression_DP`: Implements regression with differential privacy
- `Classification_CEN`: Implements centralized classification

### setting_impl.py

Contains implementations for configuration settings.

## How to Use

To use these implementations in your experiments, specify them in your configuration files. For example:

```json
{
    "framework": "FedAvg",
    "byzantine_settings": {
        "byzantine_attack": "LabelFlipping",
        "byzantine_defend": "Krum",
        "adv_rate": 0.3
    },
    ...
}
```

## How to Create Custom Implementations

To create your own custom implementation:

1. Create a new class in the appropriate file
2. Inherit from the corresponding abstract class in `meta_define`
3. Implement all required methods
4. Your implementation will be automatically registered and available for use in experiments

### Example: Creating a Custom Attack

```python
# In attack_attack_impl.py
from meta_define.attack import Attack

class MyCustomAttack(Attack):
    def __init__(self, param1=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = param1
    
    def gen_gradient(self, context: dict):
        # Implement your attack logic here
        # For example, add targeted noise to specific model parameters
        c_d = context['c_d']
        model = context['model']
        optim = context['optim']
        lr = context['lr']
        loss_func = context['loss_func']
        model_state = context['model_state']
        device = context['device']
        
        # Get honest gradients first
        from impl import train_client
        client_update, _, _, _ = train_client(c_d, model, optim, lr, loss_func, model_state, device)
        
        # Modify gradients according to your attack strategy
        modified_update = {}
        for param_name, param_value in client_update.items():
            modified_update[param_name] = param_value * self.param1
            
        return modified_update
```

## Integration with Experiments

After creating your custom implementations, you can use them in experiments by updating the configuration files to reference your new classes.
